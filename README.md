# noBS Exercise Logger

### What is it?

noBS Exercise Logger is my latest attempt at creating a simple and useful tool for logging workouts, built using modern web technologies.

### Browser Support

noBS should work in the latest versions of Chrome, Safari and Firefox.  It is not currently supported in IE as of version 11 due to [an incomplete implementation of IndexedDB](http://caniuse.com/#search=indexeddb).

### How do I use it?

The latest version is continuously deployed to http://www.nobs.io provided the build is passing. It is currently in a pre-alpha state, so don't expect anything too useful at the moment.
